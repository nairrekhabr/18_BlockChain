# 18_BlockChain
## To create &amp; test first custom network blockchain transactions using MyCrypto
## In this project we create our first block chain nodes and test it for ethereum transactions.
## To begin with create 2 accounts Node1 and Node2 at the terminal.
## Once the nodes are created,at the terminal next create your custom network(example amazon)for the flow of transactions.
## Then create and configure your genesis, seal and prefund your accounts with ethereum.
## Create your network folder to store your json file required for the transaction.
## Initialize your nodes (node1 and node2). Then run them at separate terminals with the predefined run commands.
## Once the nodes(Node 1 and Node2) to are running successfully. We are ready to test our transactions.
## Go to MyCrypto testing  app and unlock your keystore to select your wallet file, do not forget to provide the password of your selected Node(example Node1 in this case).This displays your prefunded Ethereum amount.
## We can then transact using mycrypto to transfer ETH to a receiver node/account(Example choose Node 2 address). Enter a transfer ETH amount and hit send transaction. Click on the confirmation window. Select checktxStatus to view the transaction
## In the transaction window select the current transaction or enter the transaction number to view the status. Wait for the transaction status to be successful. Once confirmed the transhash details are displayed. 
## This confirms a successful blockchain ethereum transaction.
